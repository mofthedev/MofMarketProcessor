# MofMarketProcessor
An exchange engine for matching asks and bids written in Java

This project was a part of Bitrogen, a cryptocoin exchange and payment&crowdfunding platform.

Supported order types:
* market order
* limit order
* stop-loss order

Project has been cancelled. So, I decided to share the codes behind the engine.
